          <p>Private security officers are part of the private sector, work for private companies, and are paid by an employer.  Police officers are part of the public sector, work for the town or state, and are paid by the state.</p><br>
          <p>We bridge the gap between Police Officer and Private Security Officer by hiring Prior Police, and military Police officials. This brings a new look to the private security sector. This allows other security officers that have not had ploice experience work with ones who have.</p><br>
          <p>Our security officer remain active during their shifts. We randomize our foot, and mobile patrols to maintain the protection of the client property.</p>
